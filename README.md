# Applications

## Installation
```
npx http-server 
```

You need a **companies.json** File in your root directory, for example: 

```
[
    {
        "date": "2023-07-20T22:00:00.000Z",
        "name": "Company Name A",
        "job": "Developer",
        "location": "Hamburg",
        "success": "‚ùì"
    },
    ...
]
```

## Usage

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/index.html

This is only a demo for generating a HTML-Table via DOM scripting.
I just need something to play with JSON, Fetch & GitHub. ü§£
