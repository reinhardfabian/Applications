# Applications

## Installation

You need a **list.js** File in `/scripts`, for example: 

```
const companies = [
  {
    date: new Date('07 16 2023'), //first column must be date
    name: 'Company Name A',
    job: 'Developer',
    location: 'Hamburg',
    success: '❓'       // or '✅' or '💩' for example
  },
  ...
];
```

## Usage

Point you browser to index.html

This is only a demo for generating a HTML-Table via DOM scripting.
I just need something to play with GitHub. 🤣
